### ExPreSsiVeNess- Extensible Platform for Structure Visualization and Navigation

## Task
 Visualization and navigation over graph type structures. Main idea of this project is to help better         understand interdependence between objects of real software systems through vizualization of given           objects and their connections. For example, Database schema, reading metadata from a random database 
    to vizualize relations between tables. 
    As a topic for this assigment I chose to create graph structure based on worlds countries and their neighbours. Data used in project is from https://www.geodatasource.com/. 
    Each country is a node in the graph and two nodes will be connected by an edge if they are neighbour countries. This was my first web project.
   
    
    
## Tech Stack : 
  Integration platform - Python setuptools(pkg_resources)
  
  GUI - WEB (HTML,CSS,JS), Django
  
  Vizualization - D3.js
